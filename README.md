HackTX Attendee Tracking App

We use this app for retrieving and updating information about our attendees the day-of.

Configuration/Setup
1. Clone the HackTXAttendeeTracking repo and switch to the development branch
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Make sure you have the expo client installed.
    1. npm install expo-cli
4. Run 'expo start' to open a local server. This will watch your code and automatically update wherever your app is running as you make changes.
5. Running the above command opens up a webpage where you can click to run the app on an iOS (only for Mac) or Android simulator. 
6. To run on a physical device, make sure you have the 'Expo Client' app installed from the App Store. There should be an option to send a link from the server to your email. Open this email on your phone to open the project.
